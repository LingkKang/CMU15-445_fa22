# CMU 15-445 fall 2022

[CMU 15-445 Database Systems fall 2022](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/)

## Homework 1 SQL

[Homework 1 SQL](./hw1_SQL/) with SQLite 3.39.3

The origional [imdb.db](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/files/imdb-cmudb2022.db.gz) database file was not included, since it exceeds GitHub file size restriction of 100MB. 

I'm aware that some SQL of my initial attempts are pretty poor-written, but I don't mean to re-write them as they produced correct outputs. 

### Great Questions

**Q9** and **Q10** are really instructive questions. 

For [Q9](hw1_SQL/q9_9th_decile_ratings.sql), note that it's common to have multiple CET to help doing queries. 

[Q10](hw1_SQL/q10_house_of_the_dragon.sql), is a good exercise on `RECURSIVE` query, though this keyword doesn't show while selecting.
