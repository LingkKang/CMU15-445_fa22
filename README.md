# CMU 15-445 fall 2022

[CMU 15-445 Database Systems fall 2022](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/)

## Homework 1 SQL

[Assignment Overview](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/homework1/)

[Homework 1 SQL](./hw1_SQL/) with SQLite 3.39.3

The origional [imdb.db](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/files/imdb-cmudb2022.db.gz) database file was not included, since it exceeds GitHub file size restriction of 100MB. 

I'm aware that some SQL of my initial attempts are pretty poor-written, but I don't mean to re-write them as they produced correct outputs. 

### Great Questions

**Q9** and **Q10** are really instructive questions. 

For [Q9](hw1_SQL/q9_9th_decile_ratings.sql), note that it's common to have multiple CET to help doing queries. 

[Q10](hw1_SQL/q10_house_of_the_dragon.sql), is a good exercise on `RECURSIVE` query, though this keyword doesn't show while selecting. 

## Projects 

According to course instructor, all projects regarding [BusTub](https://github.com/cmu-db/bustub) should not be posted publicly. 

## History Homework Attempts

Tried some previous homeworks just for practicing and consolidating understanding. 

### Fa21 Homework 1 SQL

[Assignment Overview](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2021/homework1/)

[Homework 1 SQL](./history_hw/fa21_hw1_SQL/) with SQLite 3.39.3

Same as [hw1](#homework-1-sql), the origional [northwind-cmudb2021.db](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2021/files/northwind-cmudb2021.db.gz) database file was not included due to size issue.
